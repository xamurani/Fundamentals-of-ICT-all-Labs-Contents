<h1> 1. Introduction </h1>
<p>A major focus on science is testing theories or models. However, before a model can be tested, it has to be formulated, and the resources for the testing need to be made available. Sometimes the researcher develops an initial model, but lacks the resources to perform the test. Finding these resources can take time, especially with less than ideal communication channels. Academic publishing is one of the core methods used by researchers to communicate with one another. And yet even relatively open publishers such as PLOS and PeerJ outright reject any and all “hypothesis papers[8, 7].” Many others only accept such papers on a case by case basis. But if academic publishing is about communication, than these communications should include concerns about existing research, and suggestions for new research, not just study results. In order to improve science communication, we need a new paper format. </p>
<p>I have written a number of papers over the last few years that are not traditional scientific papers that I will use as examples of the format that I am proposing and its importance. Many of the papers rely on existing information, yet they are not necessarily opinion or position papers either. The closest type of paper that exists in academic publishing might be the literature review, and yet they are more than that as well. They are “call to research” papers and consist of two parts. The first part of the format is very similar to a literature review, but is a bit more narrow. It does not necessarily give the entire state of the field, but rather information specific to the second part. The second part of the format considers various concerns about existing literature and makes proposals for new research. While the exact format may benefit from some changes, it is the general idea of the for that is important.</p>
<h1>2. Need</h1>
<p>The need to publicly express new research proposals, while limiting the concern about getting credit for the idea are two reasons why the call to research format is useful. But credit is not as important as promoting scientific inquiry. Someone might have a research ideas, or new concerns, but lack the resources or funds to actually complete the research themselves. Even if a researcher were to write a grant proposal, waiting to publish an idea, before a grant proposal is even accepted delays science communication even further. Even if the researcher does plan on eventually doing the research themselves, it could take years from the initial idea until the research is published. And years may be too long to wait. For instance, in my paper on Whooping Cough, the question of vaccine efficacy is of utmost importance[5]. If it is true that we are incorrectly estimating vaccine efficacy, then we must change course and create new vaccines that actually do work, and we must take precautions against transmission that we once believed to be protected against.</p>
<h1>3. The format</h1>
<p>The exact format may be left open to the journal, and there is probably no single right or wrong structure. However, the two parts of the paper should include a discussion on existing scientific literature, that acts as a foundation for a new research question. Using the existing literature, one should be able to argue why the literature is incomplete, why there are concerns about the current state of the field, and why the proposed research being developed in the paper will help improve current scientific understanding of the topic.
In most of my call to research papers, I split the paper into two identifiable sections. The first section gives an overview of the field. It is not as comprehensive as a full literature review. ”A literature review is both a summary and explanation of the complete and current state of knowledge on a limited topic as found in academic books and journal articles[11].” While a brief overview is provided, the majority of the studies cited are used specifically to form the foundation of the proposed research. Therefore, the length and detail of the first half of the paper is determined by how much supporting information is needed in the second part of the paper. The second part of the paper focuses on one or more proposed theories and tests for those theories. Discussion on this matter is generally brief as well. It does not explain the full research protocol that would be used, but provides enough detail so that another researcher could develop a full plan to test the theory. It may also contain other general concerns about the state of the field.
</p>
<h1>4. Publication</h1>
<p>I wish to address the notion of authority in writing this kind of paper. While a Call to Research paper must be of scholarly nature, including care to avoid plagiarisms, ensuring proper citation, provided well argued ideas, and be well written so that it is accessible by any member of the academic community, expertise and authority in the field should not be a necessity. This allowance is not generally provided for general literature reviews. Indeed, as the University of Michigan Research Library details,</p>
<p>Reviews are usually published by experts in the field. Being familiar with the structure and purpose of reviews will help you navigate scientific literature more confidently, but remember that it is not likely you will be writing a review for publication in a journal until well into your career. Sometimes, journal editors will invite scientists to write a review for their journal.[6]</p>
<p>While this requirement seems reasonable in a detailed literature review, which is expected to inform the general research community about the state of a given field, it is a requirement that would stifle the ability of a researcher to express a novel and potentially important idea, as well as the community’s ability to voice concerns. This behavior is the exact opposite of what we should be doing as researchers, especially because design thinking, which relies on unfettered idiation, is crucial to the advancement of research[2].
Because academic publishing is still very important, I do think that publishers should be open to accepting this format. Even if the mainstream publishers are not willing to accept this format, Open Science Framework (OSF) and ResearchGate offer an alternative. OSF is a general fraemework for developing preprints and is a ”free and open source project management repository that supports researchers across their entire project lifecycle[10].” ResearchGate has many similar features, but markets itself as a ”professional network for scientists and researchers[9].” Posting these articles on either, or both, of these platforms will allow authors to connect with other researchers, share their theories, and potentially find research partners.
I do not know whether this format will become popular. I also do not know how accepting academic journals will be about this type of publication. However, if research is to become more open and scientific theories are to be updated and shared on a regular basis, this format, or some other format of a similar nature, will need to be at the forefront of scientific communication. This is not to say that traditional article formats, which focus on primary results and the collection of new data will not be just as important to scientific inquiry as they have always been. It is just that we need to take advantage of every avenue of communication that we have at our disposal, especially with the rise of social networks and article repositories geared to storing and sharing our ideas and our results.
